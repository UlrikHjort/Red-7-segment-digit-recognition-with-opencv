Used to extract digits for training the neural network. Align camera so it roughly only shows the digits (redefine crop window in code if necessary) Show all the digits needed to be detected on the display and capture them. Show the desired digits on the display (e.g from 0 to 9)and press 's' to extract each digit and save it to a file. If the captured image is satisfying press 'r' to recapture a new one before saving. The digits are named by their x positon from left to right. In this case 4 digits are captured in one batch since the 3641AS display is used. digits are saved in the 'tmp' directory on the location where the script is executed (remember to create directory manually if it does not exist).After capturing the digits rename the files to match the digit e.g 0.png, 1.png, etc. and move the renamed files to the 'data' directory (create it if it does not exist).                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
modelAndPredict.py usage:                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Make sure a data directory is created as described above with extractDigits.py. Align camera so it roughly shows the digits and adjust crop window in code if necessary. Som extra filtering can be necessary also depending on light condictions etc which can create reflections and false positives (e.g segments reflect light). Having the display on a dark/black surface is advisable.                                                                                                   
An simple sequential Keras model with one flattern layer and two dense layers is used with additional dropout layer for better generalization and to avoid overfitting the training data. The model is trained with only a single sample of each digit which seems to work ok if setup is aligned probably (Digits do not vary as long at setup is keept steady). A noise function is included to add gaussian noise to an image and is intented to be used to create slightly different images from same test image. It does not seems to be necessary though to use this.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
As test setup a 1080p webcam and an arduino UNO was used with an 3641AS red led 7 segment display (Arduino code is included in segment.ino)
